# GG WP
GG WP is an application for ESports competition. The app makes it easy to create and hold a competiton, by allowing thru a user-friendly interface to control the state of the championship, enter scores, see the brackets and the winner.

In the first stage the application will not communicate with a server, but will keep everything in memory and will allow the user to save and load the current state of a game.

An integration with Travis CI has been made to allow the developers to track the build status.

This application is created as a personal project out of the passion of gaming and to serve as a learning environment.
